		In this era,there are more than 3 billion people in this world are on the Internet. It means Internet has become one of the needs of a human's daily life. But there are a few people know about the history of the Internet and how Internet can be developed. First let's briefly introduce about the Internet.What is Internet? The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard <a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/TCP-IP"><i>TCP/IP</i></a> to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network that consists of millions of private, public, business and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies.The video below is briefly showing what is Internet.<br/><video width="1080

			<h3>History</h3>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk about the history of the Internet, we have to go back to 50 years ago:
			<table border="1" width="400">
				<tr>
					<td>Year</td>
					<td>Incident</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1962</td>
					<td>JCR Licklider proposed a network of computers that talk to each other.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1969</td>
					<td>The first message ( the word "LOGIN") was sent from USCLA to Stanford by <a href="https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/ARPANET">ARPANET</a></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1971</td>
					<td>Ray Tomlinson was developing a system to send mail between users of ARPANET, called email</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1971</td>
					<td>Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed TCP/IP</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1983</td>
					<td>The researchers began to assemble the "network of networks" that became the modern Internet.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1990</td>
					<td>Tim Berners-Lee invented World Wide Web(WWW)</td>
				</tr>

			<h3>Future</h3>
			There are a number of published articles, features and works attempting to predict how the Internet and our world of technology will develop. The predictions run the gamut, as you might imagine, but there are a few principles that stands out accross most sources and predictions:
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li><strong>Machines might take over people's job.</strong> Now, machines are starting to gain mastery over high-level and intellectual tasks, like writing. Combined with the ubiquity of the Internet, these applications will make it so that less work and more resources are directly available. The need for people to work will decrease along with job availability.</li>
				<li><strong>Privacy will became commoditized.</strong> With a constant connection to the Internet and more applications that run our lives, privacy will become an bigger concern. It may even be commoditized to the point where only the rich can afford to be off the grid.</li>
				<li><strong>The Internet Of Things(IoT) will fully mature.</strong> Nowadays, the IoT connects refridgerators, alarm clocks, and other home appliances. In another 15 years, that connection will extend to vehicles and payments et cetera. </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a good feeling about the Internet. It is because Internet is a good technology that has helped humans a lot. The most obvious example, search engine. Internet search engine has given us to the most. A portal leads us to everywhere we want. Two of the most obvious examples, Google and DuckDuckGo Thus, as a member of this world, I hope the Internet will keep enhancing to a whole new level.
